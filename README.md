# Advent of Code 2023
This repo contains the code I used in the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems for 2023.

I did all of my solutions to this years problems in C++ as I am trying to familiarize myself with the language. I have been coding in Java for a year and a half (at Univeristy) and now I am trying to learn C++. Prior to this I have not really done any projects in C++, but I have been dabbling in C for fun on leetcode to help me understand pointers and memory management.
